        info : ['Malachite is beautiful, rich green copper carbonate hydroxide mineral that has been mined and smelted in Israel for more than 3,000 years. It has also been found in Russia, Gabon, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Namibia, Zambia, Tsumeb, Mexico, New South Wales, France, and the southwestern United States. At deposit sites, malachite is commonly found along with goethite, calcite, and azurite where copper ores have been weathered. It exhibits a monoclinic crystal system, a translucent to opaque diaphaneity, a Moh\'s scale hardness of 3.5 to 4, a specific gravity of 3.6 to 4, and a range of possibilities for luster depending on the type of specimen (massive, fibrous, etc.). Malachite has been used as a source of pigment, as a gemstone, and as an ornamental stone. Several famous decorative vases have been made of malachite. It is important to note that malachite should only be handled in its finished, polished form, as it is a toxic substance. Its dust should not be breathed in. On a metaphysical level, malachite represents the deep healing green of Mother Earth and the beauty we see in nature every day. It is also a stone of transformation and protection. It is supposed to protect us from negative energies and pollution. Wearers and carriers are advised to keep them near televisions, microwaves, or in the workplace. It may guard against electromagnetic pollution, radiation,  negative e-mails or phone calls, over bright lighting, noise pollution and other damaging rays. It might come in handy in particular if you are a secretary, miner, or airline worker, as it is said to promote clear thinking and protection from accidents. If you get nervous when you have to travel, keeping a specimen of malachite with you might help to ease your nerves. It is supposed to encourage safe and smooth travel whether by car or airplane. Just hold the malachite before you leave for your trip, to empower it, and you will have an amulet of protection as a traveling partner. It is also called a stone of transformation because it may allow you to see and break blockages that stand in the way of your spiritual growth, and encourages emotional risk-taking and change. Malachite is said to emit physical healing energies, as well. It is sometimes referred to as the midwife stone, as it is often used to regulate the menstrual cycle and PMS symptoms (such as cramps), ease labor, and treat sexual disease. It is also believed to provide healing benefits for those suffering from malaria, cold sweats, Parkinson\'s disease, rheumatic pain, intestinal disease, asthma, gall and kidney stones, high blood pressure, vertigo and motion sickness, epilepsy, broken bones and torn muscles, growths or tumors, swollen joints, or a weak or compromised immune system. If you have a liver that it not functioning properly, the presence of malachite may help stimulate it to release harmful toxins.'],

        info : ['Moonstone is a beautiful shimmery stone that has always been surrounded by a great deal of magic and mystique. It is even regarded as holy in many cultures. In India, it is regarded as a dream stone that brings its wearer beautiful visions during the night. In Arabic countries, it is sewn into the garments of women, as it is believed to bring fertility. The Greeks and Romans associated it with their lunar deities. The most classic specimens come from Sri Lanka, but moonstone has also been found in Australia, Brazil, Myanmar, Madagascar, the United States, and other locations. It is made up of orthoclase and albite-- two species of feldspar. In its creation, these feldspars are intermingled and then separate into stacked and alternating layers as the mineral cools. These stones are almost always cut as cabochons, but sometimes they are also made into cameos and/or engraved. For centuries, they have been used in jewelry. Their famous mysterious shimmer (or adularescence, as it is called in the trade) is mostly brought to bear by the skill of the cutter. Moonstone is a sodium potassium aluminum silicate that exists in numerous colors and exhibits a specific gravity of 2.61, a white streak, an opalescent luster and an uneven to conchoidal fracture. Its Moh\'s scale hardness of 6 means that it must be handled with care. Moonstone is associated with the moon (of course), the element of wind, the 13th wedding anniversary, the third eye and crown chakras, the zodiac signs of cancer and sagittarius, the months of April, June, August and October, and the state of Florida (although it does not occur there naturally). It is believed to give off energies of luck, power, healing and love. Simply keep moonstone with you or wear it in the form of jewelry in order to allow it to influence your vibrational energy. This may entail protection at sea and on land, success in matters of business and love, incoming of inspiration, enhancement of intuition and the personality, increased ability to foretell the future, and overall good fortune. It is said that  you can guarantee passion in your relationship with your lover forever if you gift him or her with a moonstone necklace during a full moon. Moonstone is also believed to be a great aid in meditation and an excellent stone for teenagers and women, in particular. In the world of physical healing, crystal healers have used moonstone to maintain the biological rhythms of the body, bring balance to the endocrine system, reduce fluid retention, promote growth in children and teenagers, slow degeneration of the body due to the aging process, enhance nutrient assimilation, eliminate toxins, and treat insomnia and conditions of the digestive system, eyes, skin, hair and fleshy organs. Additionally, it is believed to have a profound effect on the female reproductive system, easing menstrual and menopause problems, increasing fertility, facilitating healthy pregnancy and childbirth, and more. A stone for “new beginnings”, Moonstone is a stone of inner growth and strength.  It soothes emotional instability and stress, and stabilises the emotions, providing calmness.  Moonstone enhances intuition, promotes inspiration, success and good fortune in love and business matters. Moonstone aids the digestive system, assimilates nutrients, eliminates toxins and fluid retention, and alleviates degenerative conditions of skin, hair, eyes, and fleshy organs such as the liver and pancreas.  It stimulates the pineal gland and balances hormonal cycles, being excellent for PMS, conception, pregnancy, childbirth, and breast-feeding.  Moonstone is also beneficial to men in opening the emotional self.'],
